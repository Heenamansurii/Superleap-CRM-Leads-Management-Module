# Superleap-CRM-Leads-Management-Module
Project Description:
The Superleap CRM system provides tools to manage business leads, track customer interactions, and streamline sales processes.
The Leads Management API enables integration with the CRM’s backend system, allowing external applications to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, deleting, and listing leads.
These APIs ensure consistent data handling and automate lead lifecycle management from creation to conversion.

Key Objectives:

Validate all CRUD operations of the Leads Management API.

Ensure correct handling of positive and negative test scenarios.

Verify authentication, data validation, and response integrity.

Confirm compliance with REST API standards (status codes, content type, etc.).
